    <h1>Thank You, PUJA NANI (MAINSHI)</h1>
    <div class="message">
        <p>Thank you for treating me as your own brother. </p>
        <p>The day you get married, I know I’ll smile for you… but a part of my heart will quietly miss having you so close.</p>
        <p>Watching you start a new life will make me proud, even if my eyes get a little wet that day.</p>
        <p>You may belong to a new home then, but you will always remain my sister, forever.No matter whose house you live in, my care, concern, and love for you will never change.</p>
        <p>That day I won’t cry because I’m losing you, but because I’m grateful I was lucky enough to have you as my sister.Wherever life takes you, remember there will always be a brother here whose heart is proud of you.</p>
