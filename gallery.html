        <h2>My 500-Word Wish for You</h2>
        <p>Dear Abhilipsa, on this special day, I want to pour out my heart in words that capture just how much you mean to me. From the moment we met, you've been more than just a friend—you've been the sister I never had, the one who laughs at my terrible jokes, shares my love for tech, and always has my back. Remember that time we stayed up all night debugging that project? You turned chaos into clarity, and that's exactly what you've done for my life. You're the one who reminds me to take breaks, to appreciate the small wins, and to keep pushing forward.</p>
        <p>As a CSE enthusiast, I admire how you tackle problems like a pro—whether it's coding a new app or navigating life's curveballs. Your creativity shines in everything you do, from your innovative ideas to the way you make even mundane days feel exciting. I wish for you a year filled with breakthroughs, where every line of code compiles perfectly, and every project you touch turns into something amazing. May your algorithms always optimize for happiness, and may your data structures be free of errors.</p>
        <p>But beyond the tech, you're a beacon of kindness. You've taught me the value of empathy, of listening without judgment, and of celebrating others' successes. In a world that's often harsh, you're the soft reset button that brings everything back to balance. I hope this birthday brings you joy in abundance—new adventures, deeper connections, and moments that make your heart skip a beat. Travel to places that inspire you, learn skills that challenge you, and surround yourself with people who uplift you.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, I see you achieving great things. Maybe leading a team, inventing something groundbreaking, or simply living a life that's authentically yours. Whatever path you choose, know that I'm here cheering you on. You've inspired me to be better, to code with purpose, and to value relationships over everything. Thank you for being my sister-cum-friend, for the late-night talks, the shared dreams, and the unwavering support. May this year be your best yet—filled with love, laughter, and limitless possibilities. Happy Birthday, Abhilipsa! You deserve all the happiness in the world. (Word count: ~498—edit to fit exactly if needed.)</p>
