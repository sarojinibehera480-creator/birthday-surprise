    <h1>Thank You, Abhilipsa</h1>
    <div class="message">
        <p>Thank you for treating me as your own brother. On this special day, I promise to you that I will always treat you as my own sister and give you priority more than myself, as my own family.</p>
        <p>Emotional Line 1: You've filled a void in my life I didn't know existed, turning strangers into soulmates.</p>
        <p>Emotional Line 2: In the code of life, you're the function that makes everything work—reliable, beautiful, and essential.</p>
        <p>Emotional Line 3: No matter the distance or time, our bond is unbreakable, like a well-written script that runs forever.</p>
        <p>Emotional Line 4: You've shown me what true family feels like, and for that, I'm eternally grateful. Here's to many more shared memories!</p>
